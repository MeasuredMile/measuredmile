# Digital Detox: Reclaiming Your Attention in a Distracted World

In today's hyperconnected world, our devices compete constantly for our limited attention. The average person checks their phone over 150 times per day, and many of us spend more than six hours daily staring at screens outside of work.

A digital detox isn't about rejecting technology entirely – it's about establishing a healthier relationship with your devices. It's about creating space for the activities, relationships, and thoughts that truly matter.

## My Approach to Digital Detox

I believe in pragmatic, realistic approaches to digital wellbeing. You won't find extreme solutions or judgment here – just honest reflections and tested strategies that acknowledge the complex reality of modern digital life.

My goal is to help you find your own measured balance – where technology serves your values and goals rather than undermining them.
