## Measured Mile Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** April 25, 2025

Welcome to Measured Mile. Your privacy is critically important to me. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information that may be collected from you or that you may provide when you visit the website measuredmile.com (the "Website") and subscribe to the newsletter, and my practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.

This policy applies to information collected:

* On this Website.
* In email, text, and other electronic messages between you and this Website (specifically, the newsletter).

It does not apply to information collected by any third party, including through any application or content that may link to or be accessible from the Website (unless explicitly stated, such as the newsletter provider).

Please read this policy carefully to understand my policies and practices regarding your information and how I will treat it. By accessing or using this Website or subscribing to the newsletter, you agree to this privacy policy.

### Information I Collect

1.  **Newsletter Subscription:** If you choose to subscribe to the Measured Mile newsletter, I collect your **email address**. This is processed through Buttondown (buttondown.email), my email service provider. You can view Buttondown's privacy policy [here](https://buttondown.email/privacy).
2.  **Website Analytics:** This website aims for minimal data collection. [**Note:** *If you use analytics like Plausible, Fathom, GoatCounter, or Simple Analytics, mention it here and link to their privacy policy. If you use Google Analytics, be more detailed about data collected. If you use *no* analytics, state that clearly.*] For example: "This website uses Plausible Analytics to gather anonymous aggregate statistics about website traffic (e.g., page views, referral sources). Plausible does not use cookies and does not collect personal data. See the [Plausible Data Policy](https://plausible.io/data-policy)." *Or, if none:* "This website does not use any third-party analytics services."
3.  **Contact Form/Emails:** If you contact me directly via email or a contact form (if available), I will collect your email address and any other information you choose to provide in your message to respond to your inquiry.

### How I Use Your Information

I use the information collected primarily to:

* Send you the newsletter if you have subscribed.
* Respond to your direct inquiries.
* [If applicable] Understand website traffic patterns to improve the Website's content and user experience (using anonymized data).

### Cookies and Tracking

This website is committed to respecting your privacy and operates with **zero tracking cookies**.

* **No Tracking Cookies:** I do not use cookies for advertising, tracking your behavior across different websites, or building user profiles.
* **Functional Cookies (If Applicable):** [**Note:** *If your site uses essential cookies, e.g., for remembering login status if you add that later, mention them here. If not, omit this.*] For example: "The website may use essential functional cookies strictly necessary for its operation, such as remembering session information if you log in. These do not track personal activity." *Or, if none:* "No cookies are used on this website."
* **Third-Party Cookies:** My email provider, Buttondown, may use cookies as part of their service when you interact with subscription forms or emails. Please refer to their privacy policy linked above.

### Data Sharing and Disclosure

I do not sell, trade, or rent your personal identification information to others.

* **Email Provider:** Your email address is shared with Buttondown solely for the purpose of delivering the newsletter you subscribed to.
* **Analytics Provider (If Applicable):** [If using analytics] Anonymized website usage data may be processed by the analytics provider mentioned above according to their privacy policy.
* **Legal Requirements:** I may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).

### Data Security

I take reasonable measures to protect the information submitted to me, both during transmission and once received. Your email address is stored securely within the Buttondown service. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you are under 13, do not provide any information on this Website or subscribe to the newsletter. If I learn I have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, I will delete that information.
