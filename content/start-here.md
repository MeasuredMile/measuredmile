Hi there, welcome. If you sometimes feel a bit lost in all the digital noise, or maybe just overwhelmed by notifications and the constant pull of your devices, you're not alone. I'm Michael, and this site, Measured Mile, is where I try to figure out how to navigate tech with a bit more intention and balance. I'm a law professor who studies technology and digital culture, but like most people, I still find it a struggle sometimes. This is where I share what I'm learning.

## Is This Spot for You?

Does any of this ring a bell?

  * You've looked up from your phone and wondered where the last hour (or two) went.
  * You miss being able to read a book or listen to music for more than 5 consecutive minutes before flipping to something else.
  * You're tired of the constant pings, updates, and feeling like you *have* to keep up.
  * You'd like a healthier relationship with tech, without necessarily ditching it completely.
  * You're looking for practical ideas, not just lofty "digital detox" challenges that don't fit real life.

If so, maybe you'll find something useful here. I started Measured Mile because I felt like there had to be a middle ground between being totally plugged in and completely offline.

The goal isn't perfection, just finding *your* way forward.


## What I Write About Here

This site is pretty straightforward – no ads, no tracking, just things I've found helpful or interesting. I tend to write about a few different things:

  * **Practical Stuff:** Sometimes I put together how-to guides on things like managing digital tools or setting up boundaries that actually work. Think things like figuring out [how to leave Facebook for good](https://www.google.com/search?q=/reclaim-attention/how-to-delete-facebook/) or trying a [gentle approach to digital minimalism](https://www.google.com/search?q=/reclaim-attention/digital-minimalism-beginners/). I also explore ideas like creating [tech-free spots at home](https://www.google.com/search?q=/offline-living/tech-free-sanctuary/).
  * **Thinking Out Loud:** Other times, I dive into the bigger picture – stuff like how [The Attention Economy](https://www.google.com/search?q=/find-balance/attention-economy-explained/) works, what it means when services are ["free"](https://www.google.com/search?q=/protect-privacy/free-means-youre-product/), or the rise of [Digital Anxiety](https://www.google.com/search?q=/find-balance/digital-anxiety/). It helps me (and maybe you?) make sense of it all.
  * **Tools and Tech:** I also look at specific tech designed to help, like [E-Readers](https://www.google.com/search?q=/choose-better-tech/best-ereaders-2025/) or [Minimalist Phones](https://www.google.com/search?q=/choose-better-tech/minimalist-phones-review/), trying to give an honest take on whether they actually help or just add more clutter. Even simple things like [Paper Planners](https://www.google.com/search?q=/offline-living/best-paper-planners/) get a look-in.

## How Things Are Organized (Loosely)

If you browse around, you'll see posts generally fit into these buckets:

1.  **[Reclaim Your Attention](https://www.google.com/search?q=/reclaim-attention/):** Ideas for dealing with digital overwhelm.
2.  **[Choose Better Tech](https://www.google.com/search?q=/choose-better-tech/):** Looking at tech that hopefully respects our time.
3.  **[Find Digital Balance](https://www.google.com/search?q=/find-balance/):** Thoughts on focus and mental well-being.
4.  **[Protect Your Privacy](https://www.google.com/search?q=/protect-privacy/):** Practical tips for managing your data.
5.  **[Rediscover Offline Living](https://www.google.com/search?q=/offline-living/):** Finding joy in non-digital things.

## My Angle: It's not our fault that our brains are mush.

The main thing about this site is that it's grounded in reality. I'm not going to tell you tech is evil or that you need some radical purge. I've tried stuff like that and honestly, it's never worked long-term.

I think figuring this stuff out involves looking at our own habits *and* understanding how these technologies are designed. Sometimes it feels hard because it *is* hard – the odds are often stacked against our attention spans. So, what I write comes from my academic background, sure, but also just years of trying things out myself, messing up, and trying again. I run this site independently, outside of social media, as a quiet place to read and think.

## Where to Start

If you're not sure where to jump in, here are a few posts that might give you a feel for the place:

  * A practical starting point: [The Ultimate Digital Detox Guide for Realists](https://www.google.com/search?q=/reclaim-attention/ultimate-digital-detox-guide/)
  * A structured experiment: [Digital Minimalism for Beginners: 30-Day Challenge](https://www.google.com/search?q=/reclaim-attention/digital-minimalism-beginners/)
  * Understanding the context: [The Attention Economy](https://www.google.com/search?q=/find-balance/attention-economy-explained/)
  * Setting some rules for yourself: [Building a Personal Communication Protocol](https://www.google.com/search?q=/find-balance/personal-communication-protocol/)

## Keeping in Touch (If You Like)

I have a simple newsletter if you want updates when I post something new (usually not more than twice a week). It's just a direct way to share things, without any social media algorithms. Sometimes I include extra thoughts or links I found interesting.

No pressure at all, but if you're interested, you can sign up below. I respect your privacy and I won't share your email. As a small thank you, I'll send you a little "Digital Detox Starter Kit" I put together.

## Thanks for stopping by.

Glad you stopped by. I hope you find something helpful while you're here.
