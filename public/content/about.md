    Hi, I'm Michael. This whole project, Measured Mile, kind of kicked off without much fanfare one Tuesday afternoon in my office on campus. I'd just closed another set of notifications that completely derailed my thinking for about the third time that hour.</p>
<p>     Here's the slightly ironic part: I'm a law professor, and I spend a lot of my time studying technology law and digital culture. I understand, academically at least, how these apps and platforms are built to grab our attention, how the fine print usually benefits the companies, and how algorithms keep us hooked. But knowing all that didn't stop me from feeling overwhelmed and distracted myself.
</p>

<p>So, Measured Mile really just grew out of my own attempts to figure out a healthier way to live with technology. Like a lot of people, I can't just disconnect entirely â€“ it's not realistic for my life or work. But I strongly felt (and still feel) that finding a more intentional, measured approach is possible, and frankly, necessary for sanity. This site is where I explore that idea, mostly in my spare time.</p>

## Is this for you?

    This site is for anyone who is tired of scrolling and wondering where their free time went. It's for people who miss being able to read or listen to music without feeling antsy. It's for people who want to feel like they're using tech as a tool, not the other way around.
</p>

<p>
    You don't need to toss your phone in a river. It's really just for anyone who wants to be a bit more intentional about how technology fits into their life.

## Keeping in Touch

<p>I mainly share new thoughts and articles through a simple email newsletter. It's a direct way to connect, away from the noise of algorithms. If that sounds interesting, you can find a link to it over on the Start Here page.</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by and reading a bit about the story behind this place.</p>
